# Udyog Jaal - Network Of Jobs

Udyog Jaal is an innovative application designed to address the lack of transparency and efficiency in the job market for skilled employees. The app aims to bridge the gap between job seekers and job providers by providing a platform where users can upload their personal information, contact details, and skill sets.

## Problem Statement

The current job market lacks transparency, making it challenging for both employees and employers to connect with the right opportunities and candidates, respectively. Skilled employees often end up being underpaid and underutilized, while job providers struggle to find suitable candidates for their specific job requirements.

## Solution

Udyog Jaal - Network of Jobs is our solution to the aforementioned problem. The application serves as a networking platform, enabling job seekers to easily find suitable job opportunities based on their skills and preferences.
